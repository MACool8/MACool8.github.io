                <h2>Introduction Side-Channels</h2>
                <p>Have you ever burned a disc and knew that it's almost done, just by hearing the disc spinning slower and slower? If yes, than congratilution you already used a side channel to your advantage.</p>
                <p>Side channels information can be gathered from a system in an indirect way. For example the sound of discs spinning, the time it takes to calculate if your password is correct or even how much power draw is currently taken by your system. </p>
